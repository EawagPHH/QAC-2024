AB  - Contaminated surfaces play a major role in disease transmission to humans. The 
      vast majority of commercial disinfectants provide short-term protection of 
      surfaces against microbial contamination. The Covid-19 pandemic has attracted 
      attention to the importance of long-term disinfectants as they would reduce the 
      need for staff and save time. In this study, nanoemulsions and nanomicelles 
      containing a combination of benzalkonium chloride (BKC; a potent disinfectant and 
      a surfactant) and benzoyl peroxide (BPO; a stable form of peroxide that is 
      activated upon contact with lipid/membranous material) were formulated. The 
      prepared nanoemulsion and nanomicelle formulas were of small sizes <80 nm and 
      high positive charge >45 mV. They showed enhanced stability and prolonged 
      antimicrobial efficacy. The antibacterial potency was evaluated in terms of 
      long-term disinfection on surfaces as verified by repeated bacterial inoculums. 
      Additionally, the efficacy of killing bacteria upon contact was also 
      investigated. A nanomicelle formula (NM-3) consisting of 0.8% BPO in acetone and 
      2% BKC plus 1% TX-100 in distilled water (1 : 5 volume ratio) demonstrated 
      overall surface protection over a period of 7 weeks upon a single spray 
      application. Furthermore, its antiviral activity was tested by the embryo chick 
      development assay. The prepared NM-3 nanoformula spray showed strong 
      antibacterial activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and 
      Staphylococcus aureus as well as antiviral activities against infectious 
      bronchitis virus due to the dual effects of BKC and BPO. The prepared NM-3 spray 
      shows great potential as an effective solution for prolonged surface protection 
      against multiple pathogens.

TI  - A Systematic Review and Quantitative Synthesis of the Efficacy of Quaternary 
      Ammonium Compounds in Disinfesting Nonfungal Plant Pathogens.
PG  - 3176-3187
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-12-21-2751-RE [doi]
AB  - This quantitative review and systematic analysis of the effectiveness of 
      quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) in disinfesting nonfungal plant pathogens in 
      agricultural and horticultural cropping systems is a complementary follow-up to a 
      previous study that evaluated the efficacy of QACs against fungal plant 
      pathogens. In the present study, a meta-analysis involving 67 studies was 
      conducted to assess the overall efficacy of QACs against plant pathogenic 
      bacteria, oomycetes, and viruses and to identify factors associated with observed 
      differences in product efficacy. Across all studies, QACs resulted in a 
      significant (P < 0.0001) reduction in either disease intensity or propagule 
      viability with a mean Hedges' g ([Formula: see text]) of 1.75, indicating that 
      overall QAC treatments were moderately effective against nonfungal pathogens. 
      Significant differences in product efficacy were observed between organism types 
      (P = 0.0001), with QAC interventions resulting in higher efficacy (P = 0.0002) 
      against oomycetes ([Formula: see text] = 4.20) than against viruses ([Formula: 
      see text] = 1.42) and bacteria ([Formula: see text] = 1.07), which were not 
      different (P = 0.2689) from each other. As a result, bacterium and virus types 
      were combined into a composite set (BacVir). QAC intervention against BacVir 
      resulted in significant differences in efficacy within categorical moderator 
      subgroups for genus (P = 0.0133), target material (P = 0.0001), and QAC product 
      generation (P = 0.0281). QAC intervention against oomycetes resulted in 
      significant differences in efficacy only for genus (P < 0.0001). For the BacVir 
      composite, five random effect (RE) meta-regression models were significant (P = 
      0.05), where models with dose and time, dose and genus, time and genus, dose and 
      target, and time and target accounted for 62, 61, 52, 83, and 88%, respectively, 
      of the variance in true effect sizes (R(2)) associated with [Formula: see text]. 
      For oomycetes, three RE meta-regression models were significant (P = 0.05), where 
      models with dose and time, dose and genus, and time and genus accounted for 64, 
      86, and 90%, respectively, of R(2) associated with [Formula: see text]. These 
      results show that while QACs are moderately effective against nonfungal plant 
      pathogens, the observed variability in their efficacy due to dose of active 
      ingredient and contact time of these products can be influenced by organism type, 
      genus within organism type, the target being treated, and the generation of QAC 
      products.

TI  - Evaluation of the Efficacy of Commercial Disinfectants against African Swine 
      Fever Virus.
LID - 10.3390/pathogens12070855 [doi]
LID - 855
AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is an economically important disease due to high 
      morbidity and mortality rates and the ability to affect all ages and breeds of 
      pigs. Biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of the causative agent, African 
      swine fever virus (ASFV), include prescriptive cleaning and disinfection 
      procedures. The aim of this study was to establish the biocidal effects of 
      twenty-four commercially available disinfectants including oxidizing agents, 
      acids, aldehydes, formic acids, phenol, and mixed-class chemistries against ASFV. 
      The products were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and a 
      suspension assay was performed with ASFV strain, BA71V using Vero cells (African 
      green monkey cells) to test efficacy in reducing ASFV infection of cells. 
      Generally, disinfectants containing formic acid and phenolic compounds, as well 
      as oxidizing agents reduced viral titers of ASFV by over 4 log(10) at 
      temperatures ranging from 4 °C to 20 °C. Hydrogen peroxide, aldehyde, and 
      quaternary ammonium compounds containing disinfectants were cytotoxic, limiting 
      the detection of viral infectivity reductions to less than 4 log(10). These 
      preliminary results can be used to target research on disinfectants which contain 
      active ingredients with known efficacy against ASFV under conditions recommended 
      for the country where their use will be applied.

      HCoV-229E.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although three years after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the virus is 
      still having a significant impact on human health and the global economy. 
      Infection through respiratory droplets is the main transmission route, but the 
      transmission of the virus by surface contact cannot be ignored. Hand sanitizers 
      and antiviral films can be applied to control SARS-CoV-2, but sanitizers and 
      films show drawbacks such as resistance of the virus against ethanol and 
      environmental problems including the overuse of plastics. Therefore, this study 
      suggested applying natural substrates to hand sanitizers and antiviral films made 
      of biodegradable plastic (PLA). This approach is expected to provide advantages 
      for the easy control of SARS-CoV-2 through the application of natural substances. 
      METHODS: Antiviral disinfectants and films were manufactured by adding caffeic 
      acid and vanillin to ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, benzalkonium chloride, and PLA. 
      Antiviral efficacies were evaluated with slightly modified international standard 
      testing methods EN 14,476 and ISO 21,702. RESULTS: In suspension, all the hand 
      sanitizers evaluated in this study showed a reduction of more than 4 log within 
      2 min against HCoV-229E. After natural substances were added to the hand 
      sanitizers, the time needed to reach the detection limit of the viral titer was 
      shortened both in suspension and porcine skin. However, no difference in the time 
      needed to reach the detection limit of the viral titer was observed in 
      benzalkonium chloride. In the case of antiviral films, those made using both PLA 
      and natural substances showed a 1 log reduction of HCoV-229E compared to the neat 
      PLA film for all treatment groups. Furthermore, the influence of the organic load 
      was evaluated according to the number of contacts of the antiviral products with 
      porcine skin. Ten rubs on the skin resulted in slightly higher antiviral activity 
      than 50 rubs. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that caffeic acid and vanillin can 
      be effectively used to control HCoV-229E for hand sanitizers and antiviral films. 
      In addition, it is recommended to remove organic matter from the skin for 
      maintaining the antiviral activity of hand sanitizer and antiviral film as the 
      antiviral activity decreased as the organic load increased in this study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disinfection is one of the most effective ways to block the rapid 
      transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due 
      to the prolonged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, disinfectants have 
      become crucial to prevent person-to-person transmission and decontaminate hands, 
      clothes, facilities and equipment. However, there is a lack of accurate 
      information on the virucidal activity of commercial disinfectants. AIM: To 
      evaluate the virucidal efficacy of 72 commercially available disinfectants 
      constituting 16 types of ingredients against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 was 
      tested with various concentrations of disinfectants at indicated exposure time 
      points as recommended by the manufacturers. The 50% tissue culture infectious 
      dose assay was used to calculate virus titre, and trypan blue staining and CCK-8 
      were used to assess cell viability after 3-5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
      FINDINGS: This study found that disinfectants based on 83% ethanol, 60% 
      propanol/ethanol, 0.00108-0.0011% sodium dichloroisocyanurate and 0.497% 
      potassium peroxymonosulfate inactivated SARS-CoV-2 effectively and safely. 
      Although disinfectants based on 0.05-0.4% benzalkonium chloride (BAC), 0.02-0.07% 
      quaternary ammonium compound (QAC; 1:1), 0.4% BAC/didecyldimethylammonium 
      chloride (DDAC), 0.28% benzethonium chloride concentrate/2-propanol, 0.0205-0.14% 
      DDAC/polyhexamethylene biguanide hydrochloride (PHMB) and 0.5% hydrogen peroxide 
      inactivated SARS-CoV-2 effectively, they exhibited cytotoxicity. Conversely, 
      disinfectants based on 0.04-4% QAC (2:3), 0.00625% BAC/DDAC/PHMB, and 
      0.0205-0.14% and 0.0173% peracetic acid showed approximately 50% virucidal 
      efficacy with no cytotoxicity. Citric acid (0.4%) did not inactivate SARS-CoV-2. 
      CONCLUSION: These results indicate that most commercially available disinfectants 
      exert a disinfectant effect against SARS-CoV-2. However, re-evaluation of the 
      effective concentration and exposure time of certain disinfectants is needed, 
      especially citric acid and peracetic acid.

AB  - Quarantine work is widely recognized as an indispensable endeavor in curbing the 
      propagation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
      Furthermore, the heavy workload places workers at a heightened risk of chemical 
      exposure and respiratory damage. Consequently, it is paramount to systematically 
      perform health risk assessments and meticulously oversee the work by wearing 
      personal protective equipment to minimize these risks. To assess the inhalation 
      exposure, this study examined data on disinfectant exposure from quarantine 
      professional users who utilized disinfectants containing quaternary ammonium 
      compounds. Through a survey of 6,199 cases conducted by 300 quarantine 
      professional users who actively engaged in quarantine work, we assembled a 
      database of exposure factors derived from their utilization of spray-type 
      disinfectants for quarantine purposes. Based on these data, we formulated an 
      inhalation exposure algorithm, which considers the time-weighted average (TWA) 
      air concentrations. The test results demonstrated that the industrial-grade 
      respirator mask could prevent a minimum of 68.3 % of particles, reducing 
      respiratory exposure. Consequently, the hazard quotient (HQ) due to disinfectant 
      exposure also decreased. This research is essential in safeguarding the safety 
      and health of professional users engaged in quarantine-related tasks. By 
      implementing strict measures like health risk assessments and personal protective 
      equipment, individuals with quarantine experience can safely carry out their 
      quarantine work. The results of this study are expected to serve as a framework 
      for improving policies and regulations concerning quarantine work and 
      safeguarding the health of professional users.

AB  - Decapod iridescent virus 1 (DIV1) is a lethal virus that has a significant 
      influence on the shrimp and prawn culture industries. The mechanism through which 
      infected prawns respond to the DIV1 virus is currently unknown. Here, we examined 
      in detail the clinical signs, histopathology, and humoral, cellular, and 
      immune-related gene responses after a sub-lethal dose of DIV1 during the acute 
      infection period of 0-120 h post infection (hpi). Interestingly, at the end of 
      the experiment, DIV1-infected prawns had black lesions on several external 
      regions. The DIV1-infected prawns also exhibited few karyopyknotic nuclei in the 
      gills and intestine tissues and exhibited increasing immunological responses, as 
      revealed by significant increases in all examined parameters, including total 
      hemocytes, phagocytosis, lysozyme, and overall bactericidal activity, from 6 to 
      48 hpi. In addition, between 72 and 120 hpi, all immune response activities of 
      DIV1-infected prawn were impaired compared with those of normal prawns, 
      indicating negative impacts on immunological parameters. A viral load analysis of 
      various tissues by qPCR indicated that hemocytes were the dominant initial viral 
      target tissues, followed by the gills and hepatopancreas. An expression analysis 
      of crucial immune-related genes by qRT‒PCR revealed various expression patterns 
      in response to DIV1 infection; in particular, fold changes in the relative 
      expression of anti-lipopolysaccharide factors (ALFs), prophenoloxidase (proPO), 
      lipopolysaccharide and β-1,3-glucan binding protein (LGBP) were observed. 
      Additionally, five common chemicals, calcium hypochlorite [Ca(OCl)(2)] at 
      16.25-130 ppm, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) at 8.75-70 ppm, povidone iodine 
      (PVP-I) at 3-24 ppm, benzalkonium chloride (BKC) at 20-160 ppm, and formalin at 
      25-200 ppm, had a significant effect on the killing of DIV1 particles in vitro 
      within 24 h after exposure. These data will be helpful for determining the health 
      status and immune defense mechanisms of giant river prawns during DIV1 infection 
      periods. The study performed the first application of very common disinfectants, 
      and the obtained information will be useful for implementing effective strategies 
      to prevent and control DIV1 infection in both hatchery and grow-out ponds.

AB  - Biosecurity enhancement contributes to the reduction of various microbial 
      pathogens. Mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs) which are increasingly recognized as 
      potentially serious problems on swine industry were used as indicators of 
      biosecurity enhancement on two pig farms. Twelve MRVs were detected and isolated 
      from fecal specimens of healthy pigs collected from one of the two farms in 
      Japan. By sequencing based on the partial S1 gene, MRV isolates were classified 
      as MRV1 and MRV2. Additionally, the virucidal activities of disinfectants toward 
      the isolated MRV1 were evaluated using quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) diluted 
      500 times with water (QAC-500), 0.17% food additive glade calcium hydroxide 
      (FdCa(OH)(2)) solution, QAC diluted with 0.17% FdCa(OH)(2) solution (Mix-500), 
      sodium hypochlorite at 100 or 1,000 parts per million (ppm) of total chlorine 
      (NaClO-100 or NaClO-1000, respectively). To efficiently inactivate MRV1 (≥3 
      log(10) reductions), 0.17% FdCa(OH)(2), Mix-500 and NaClO-1000 required 5 min, 
      whereas it took 30 min for QAC-500. The number of MRV detections has decreased 
      over time, after using Mix-500 for disinfection on the positive farm. These 
      results suggest that different serotypes of MRVs are circulating among pigs, and 
      that the occurrence of MRVs in the farms decreased consequent to more effective 
      disinfection.

TI  - Antiviral functionalization of a polypropylene nonwoven textile structure as a 
      self-decontaminating layer for respiratory masks.
PG  - 3502-3511
LID - 10.1039/d2bm01988d [doi]
AB  - The aim of this work was to develop a filtering biocidal polypropylene (PP) 
      nonwoven textile structure to block and inactivate airborne bacteria and viruses. 
      PP filters were functionalized with a cyclodextrin (CD)-polycarboxylic 
      acid-crosslinked polymer (PP-CD) through a pad/dry/curing process, and were then 
      activated by padding in an alkyl dimethyl benzalkonium chloride (ADBAC) solution. 
      The textile finishing process parameters were optimized with the perspective of 
      mass production, considering the threshold temperature necessary for provoking 
      crosslinking and the limitation of the low thermal stability of PP. The use of an 
      aqueous solution containing hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), 
      1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA), ammonium hypophosphite (AH), and a 
      surfactant allowed immobilization of the optimal quantity of cyclodextrin polymer 
      under curing for 5 minutes at 125 °C without affecting the nonwoven PP structure. 
      The presence of CD drastically increased the sorption of ADBAC on the textiles. 
      There was leaching of ADBAC at the first rinsing and then satisfactory fastness 
      at the second and third rinsings, revealing adsorption mechanisms by weak 
      physical interactions, ionic interactions, and inclusion of ADBAC inside the CD 
      cavities. SEM revealed no clogging of the nonwoven pores, nor any increase in the 
      air flow resistance, as evaluated by pressure drop measurements. The filtration 
      efficiency of particulate matter PM(3.0) and PM(0.5) was moderately affected, in 
      contrast to that of PM(0.3), which greatly decreased due to the loss of the 
      electrostatic charge of the filter upon the functionalization process. 
      Bactericidal tests resulted in a reduction of 3 log(10) against Staphylococcus 
      aureus, and for virucidal tests on human coronavirus HCoV-229E, there was a 
      reduction of 3.4 log(10), with both strains undergoing 20 minutes of contact. 
      Finally, the filter we developed is manufacturable by a scalable process, and 
      because of its filtration and biocidal performances, it is a choice material as a 
      self-disinfecting layer in the fabrication of facepiece respirators.

TI  - Determination of 25 quaternary ammonium compounds in sludge by liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry.

AB  - With the pandemic of COVID-19, the application of quaternary ammonium compounds 
      (QACs), which can be used in SARS-CoV-2 disinfection products, has increased 
      substantially. QACs cumulated in sewer system are ultimately deposited and 
      enriched in sludge. QACs in the environment can adversely affect human health and 
      the environment. In this study, a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method 
      was established for the simultaneous determination of 25 QACs in sludge samples. 
      Ultrasonic extraction and filtration of the samples was performed using a 50 mM 
      hydrochloric acid-methanol solution. The samples were separated by liquid 
      chromatography and detected in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The matrix 
      effects of the sludge on the 25 QACs ranged from - 25.5% to 7.2%. All substances 
      showed good linearity in the range of 0.5-100 ng/mL, with all determination 
      coefficients (R(2)) greater than 0.999. The method detection limits (MDLs) were 
      9.0 ng/g for alkyltrimethylammonium chloride (ATMAC), 3.0 ng/g for 
      benzylalkyldimethylammonium chloride (BAC), and 3.0 ng/g for 
      dialkyldimethylammonium chloride (DADMAC). The spiked recovery rates were in the 
      range of 74-107%, while the relative standard deviations were in the range of 
      0.8-20.6%. Considering its sensitivity, accuracy, and easy operation, the 
      proposed method in this study was used to determine 22 sludge samples collected 
      from a comprehensive wastewater treatment plant. The results showed that the 
      concentrations of ΣATMACs, ΣBACs, and ΣDADMACs were 19.684, 3.199, and 
      8.344 μg/g, respectively. The main components included ATMAC-C16, ATMAC-C18, 
      ATMAC-C20, ATMAC-C22, BAC-C12, and DADMAC-C18:C18, with concentrations exceeding 
      1.0 μg/g. The concentration relationships of different components in the 
      congeners showed that some components were of similar origin.

AB  - Outbreaks of viral diseases in animals are a cause of concern for animal welfare 
      and economics of animal production. One way to disrupt the cycle of infection is 
      by combating viruses in the environment and prohibiting them from being 
      transmitted to a new host. Viral contamination of the environment can be reduced 
      using well-tested and efficacious disinfectants. Duplalim is a commercially 
      available disinfectant consisting of 12% glutaraldehyde and 10% quaternary 
      ammonium compounds. We evaluated this disinfectant for its efficacy against 
      several viruses in poultry (n = 3), pigs (n = 5), dogs (n = 2), and cattle 
      (n = 4). In suspension tests, 1:100 dilution of Duplalim was found to inactivate 
      more than 99% of these 14 viruses in 15 min or less. The titers of a majority of 
      these viruses decreased by ≥99.99% in <60 min of contact time. In conclusion, the 
      ingredient combination in Duplalim is very effective in inactivating common 
      viruses of domestic animals and poultry.

AB  - During the pandemic of COVID-19, the amounts of quaternary ammonium compounds 
      (QACs) used to inactivate the virus in public facilities, hospitals and 
      households increased, which raised concerns about the evolution and transmission 
      of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Although QACs may play an important role in 
      the propagation of antibiotic resistance gene (ARGs), the potential contribution 
      and mechanism remains unclear. Here, the results showed that benzyl dodecyl 
      dimethyl ammonium chloride (DDBAC) and didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC) 
      significantly promoted plasmid RP4-mediated ARGs transfer within and across 
      genera at environmental relevant concentrations (0.0004-0.4 mg/L). Low 
      concentrations of QACs did not contribute to the permeability of the cell plasma 
      membrane, but significantly increased the permeability of the cell outer membrane 
      due to the decrease in content of lipopolysaccharides. QACs altered the 
      composition and content of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and were 
      positively correlated with the conjugation frequency. Furthermore, 
      transcriptional expression levels of genes encode for mating pairing formation 
      (trbB), DNA replication and translocation (trfA), and global regulators (korA, 
      korB, trbA) are regulated by QACs. And we demonstrate for the first time that 
      QACs decreased the concentration of extracellular AI-2 signals, which was 
      verified to be involved in regulating conjugative transfer genes (trbB, trfA). 
      Collectively, our findings underscore the risk of increased disinfectant 
      concentrations of QACs on the ARGs transfer and provide new mechanisms of plasmid 
      conjugation.

      against a betacoronavirus and an alphacoronavirus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene is critical to lower the potential for the spread of 
      SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious agents by direct contact. When running water and 
      soap are not available for hand hygiene, ethanol-based hand sanitizers are 
      currently the recommended standard of care [1-3]. Though recently published data 
      showed comparable in vitro effectiveness of benzalkonium chloride (BAK)-based and 
      ethanol-based hand sanitizers against SARS-CoV-2 virus, a paucity of 
      peer-reviewed data on the effectiveness of these formulations against other types 
      of infective coronaviruses remains. This work assessed human coronavirus 
      HCoV-229E (genus Alphacoronavirus) concurrently with SARS-CoV-2, Isolate 
      USA-WA1/2020 (genus Betacoronavirus) to fill this gap. METHODS: The test was 
      conducted according to EN14476:2013-A2:2019 [EN14476] Quantitative Suspension 
      Test for the Evaluation of Virucidal Activity in the Medical Area [4]. Two 
      BAK-based hand sanitizers, five ethanol-based hand sanitizers, and an 80% ethanol 
      reference formulation were tested for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and 
      HCoV-229E at 15- and 30- second contact times. RESULTS: Both SARS-CoV-2 and 
      HCoV-229E were reduced by greater than 4.00-log(10) within 15 seconds of contact. 
      Virus decay constants (k) following first-order kinetics were similar for BAK and 
      ethanol-based formulations against both test viruses. The SARS-CoV-2 results 
      reported herein mirrored previous data reported by Herdt et al. (2021). 
      CONCLUSION: BAK and ethanol hand sanitizer formulations inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and 
      HCoV-229E at similar rates. This data supports previously published effectiveness 
      data for both chemistries and indicates that additional coronavirus strains and 
      variants would demonstrate similar inactivation trends.

AB  - In the light of the worldwide antimicrobial resistance crisis, new substitutes to 
      antibiotics are urgently needed. Tailocins or phage tail-like bacteriocin 
      particles, produced by bacteria for environmental competition, are a potential 
      antimicrobial alternative to antibiotic treatment. Yet, the availability of 
      characterized Tailocins is limited. We explored the possibility to produce new 
      Tailocins from phage particles, using osmotic shock or chemical treatment by the 
      ammonium quaternary compound benzalkonium chloride on Ackermannviridae phage S117 
      and using Straboviridae phage T4 as control. We report that phage S117 was 
      resistant to such treatment, while successful production of Tailocins by osmotic 
      shock was achieved for phage T4. Finally, chemical treatment with benzalkonium 
      chloride was inefficient on phage S117 but successfully inactivated phage T4 
      without production of Tailocins. Further studies are needed to implement such 
      treatments of phages for producing Tailocins with killing activity.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted our reliance on biocides, the increasing 
      prevalence of resistance to biocides is a risk to public health. Bacterial 
      exposure to the biocide, benzalkonium chloride (BAC), resulted in a unique 
      transcriptomic profile, characterised by both a short and long-term response. 
      Differential gene expression was observed in four main areas: motility, membrane 
      composition, proteostasis, and the stress response. A metabolism shift to protect 
      the proteome and the stress response were prioritised suggesting these are main 
      resistance mechanisms. Whereas "well-established" mechanisms, such as biofilm 
      formation, were not found to be differentially expressed after exposure to BAC.

TI  - Evaluation of Environmental Stability and Disinfectant Effectiveness for Human 
      Coronavirus OC43 on Human Skin Surface.

LID - e02381-22
AB  - The environmental stability of human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) on the surface 
      of human skin and the effectiveness of disinfectant against HCoV-OC43, which are 
      important to prevent contact transmission, have not been clarified in previous 
      studies. Using previously generated models, we evaluated HCoV-OC43 stability and 
      disinfection effectiveness. Then we compared the results with those for severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The median survival time 
      of HCoV-OC43 on the surface of human skin was 24.6 h (95% confidence interval, 
      19.7 to 29.6 h), which was higher than that of SARS-CoV-2 (10.8 h). Although the 
      in vitro disinfectant effectiveness evaluation showed that HCoV-OC43 has a higher 
      ethanol resistance than SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 on the skin surface was completely 
      inactivated by a minimum of 50% ethanol within 5 s (the log reduction values were 
      >4.0). Moreover, 1.0% chlorhexidine gluconate and 0.2% benzalkonium chloride 
      showed relatively high disinfectant effectiveness, and the log reduction values 
      when these disinfectants were applied for 15 s were >3.0. HCoV-OC43 is highly 
      stable on the skin surface, which may increase the risk of contact transmission. 
      Although HCoV-OC43 has relatively high ethanol resistance, appropriate hand 
      hygiene practices with current alcohol-based disinfectants sufficiently reduce 
      the risk of contact transmission. IMPORTANCE This study revealed the 
      environmental stability of HCoV-OC43 and disinfectant effectiveness against 
      HCoV-OC43, which had not been demonstrated in previous studies. HCoV-OC43 is 
      highly stable on the surface of human skin, with a survival time of approximately 
      25 h. High stability of HCoV-OC43 may increase the risk of contact transmission. 
      Furthermore, the in vitro disinfectant effectiveness evaluation showed that 
      HCoV-OC43, which is classified as an envelope virus, has a relatively high 
      ethanol resistance. This finding suggests that disinfectant effectiveness may 
      vary greatly depending on the virus and that each virus targeted for infection 
      control should be evaluated individually. HCoV-OC43 on the skin surface was 
      rapidly inactivated by 50% ethanol, which suggests that appropriate hand hygiene 
      practices with current alcohol-based disinfectants can sufficiently reduce the 
      risk of HCoV-OC43 contact transmission.

LID - 10.2147/IJN.S396669 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated 
      the need for novel, affordable, and efficient reagents to help reduce viral 
      transmission, especially in high-risk environments including medical treatment 
      facilities, close quarters, and austere settings. We examined transition-metal 
      nanozeolite suspensions and quaternary ammonium compounds as an antiviral surface 
      coating for various textile materials. METHODS: Zeolites are crystalline porous 
      aluminosilicate materials, with the ability of ion-exchanging different cations. 
      Nanozeolites (30 nm) were synthesized and then ion-exchanged with silver, zinc 
      and copper ions. Benzalkonium nitrate (BZN) was examined as the quaternary 
      ammonium ion (quat). Suspensions of these materials were tested for antiviral 
      activity towards SARS-CoV-2 using plaque assay and immunostaining. Suspensions of 
      the nanozeolite and quat were deposited on polyester and cotton fabrics and the 
      ability of these textiles towards neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 was examined. RESULTS: 
      We hypothesized that transition metal ion containing zeolites, particularly 
      silver and zinc (AM30) and silver and copper (AV30), would be effective in 
      reducing the infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2). Additionally, AM30 and AV30 antiviral potency was tested when 
      combined with a quaternary ammonium carrier, BZN. Our results indicate that 
      exposure of SARS-CoV-2 to AM30 and/or AV30 suspensions reduced viral loads with 
      time and exhibited dose-dependence. Antiviral activities of the combination of 
      zeolite and BZN compositions were significantly enhanced. When used in textiles, 
      AM30 and AV30-coated cotton and polyester fabrics alone or in combination with 
      BZN exhibited significant antiviral properties, which were maintained even after 
      various stress tests, including washes, SARS-CoV-2-repeated exposures, or 
      treatments with soil-like materials. CONCLUSION: This study shows the efficacy of 
      transition metal nanozeolite formulations as novel antiviral agents and 
      establishes that nanozeolite with silver and zinc ions (AM30) and nanozeolite 
      with silver and copper ions (AV30) when combined with benzalkonium nitrate (BZN) 
      quickly and continuously inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in suspension and on fabric 
      materials.

AB  - The pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus named severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which unpredictably 
      exploded in late December of 2019 has stressed the importance of being able to 
      control potential pathogens with the aim of limiting their spread. 
      Although vaccines are well known as a powerful tool for ensuring public health 
      and controlling the pandemic, disinfection and hygiene habits remain crucial to 
      prevent infection from spreading and maintain the barrier, especially when the 
      microorganism can persist and survive on textiles, surfaces, and medical devices. 
      During the coronavirus disease pandemic, around half of the disinfectants 
      authorized by the US Environmental Protection Agency contained quaternary 
      ammonium compounds (QACs); their effectiveness had not been proven. Herein, the 
      in vitro SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by p-bromodomiphen bromide, namely bromiphen 
      (BRO), a new, potent, and fast-acting QAC is reported. This study demonstrates 
      that BRO, with a dose as low as 0.02%, can completely inhibit SARS-CoV-2 
      replication in just 30 s. Its virucidal activity was 10- and 100-fold more robust 
      compared to other commercially available QACs, namely domiphen bromide and 
      benzalkonium chloride. The critical micellar concentration and the molecular 
      lipophilicity potential surface area support the relevance of the lipophilic 
      nature of these molecules for their activity.

AB  - Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are commonly used in a variety of consumer 
      and commercial products, typically as a component of disinfectants. During the 
      COVID-19 pandemic, QACs became one of the primary agents utilized to inactivate 
      the SARS-CoV-2 virus on surfaces. However, the ecotoxicological effects of QACs 
      upon aquatic organisms have not been fully assessed. In this study, we examined 
      the effects of a widely used QAC (benzalkonium chloride-C(14), BAC-14) on two 
      toxigenic Microcystis strains and one non-toxigenic freshwater Microcystis strain 
      and carried out an analysis focused on primary, adaptive and compensatory stress 
      responses at apical (growth and photosynthesis) and metabolic levels. This 
      analysis revealed that the two toxic Microcystis strains were more tolerant than 
      the non-toxic strain, with 96 hr-EC(50) values of 0.70, 0.76, and 0.38 mg/L 
      BAC-14 for toxigenic M. aeruginosa FACHB-905, toxigenic M. aeruginosa FACHB-469, 
      and non-toxigenic M. wesenbergii FACHB-908, respectively. The photosynthetic 
      activities of the Microcystis, assessed via F(v)/F(m) values, were significantly 
      suppressed under 0.4 mg/L BAC-14. Furthermore, this analysis revealed that BAC-14 
      altered 14, 12, and 8 metabolic pathways in M. aeruginosa FACHB-905, M. 
      aeruginosa FACHB-469, and M. wesenbergii FACHB-908, respectively. It is 
      noteworthy that BAC-14 enhanced the level of extracellular microcystin production 
      in the toxigenic Microcystis strains, although cell growth was not significantly 
      affected. Collectively, these data show that BAC-14 disrupted the physiological 
      and metabolic status of Microcystis cells and stimulated the production and 
      release of microcystin, which could result in damage to aquatic systems.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 outbreak led to an increased marketing of disinfectants, creating a 
      potential environmental problem. For instance, pre-pandemic environmental levels 
      of the disinfectant benzalkonium chloride (BAC) ranging from 0.5 to 5 mgL(-1) in 
      effluents were expected to further increase threatening aquatic life. Our aim was 
      to characterize potential adverse effects after an acute exposure of zebrafish to 
      different concentrations of BAC. An increase in the overall swimming activity, 
      thigmotaxis behavior, and erratic movements were observed. An increase in CYP1A1 
      and catalase activities, but inhibitions of CY1A2, GSTs and GPx activities were 
      also noticed. BAC is metabolized by CYP1A1, increasing the production of 
      H(2)O(2), thereby activating the antioxidant enzyme CAT. Data also showed an 
      increase of AChE activity. Our study highlights adverse embryonic, behavioral, 
      and metabolic effects of noteworthy environmental significance, especially 
      considering that the use and release of BAC is most likely to increase in a near 
      future.

AB  - Handwashing represents an important personal hygiene measure for preventing 
      infection. Herein, we report the persistence of antibacterial and antiviral 
      effects after handwashing with fatty acid salt-based hand soap. To this end, we 
      developed a new in vitro test method to measure persistence, utilizing 
      coacervation formed by anionic surfactants and cationic polymers to retain highly 
      effective soap components against each bacterium and virus on the skin. 
      Coacervation with fatty acid salts and poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride 
      (PDADMAC) as a cationic polymer allowed the persistence of antibacterial and 
      antiviral effects against E. coli, S. aureus, and influenza virus even 4 h after 
      handwashing. Furthermore, we confirmed an increase in the number of residual 
      components effective against each bacterium and virus on the skin. In summary, 
      the current findings describe an effective approach for enhancing the protective 
      effects of handwashing.

AB  - The use of disinfectants made from quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) has 
      greatly increased since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. However, the effect of QACs 
      on wastewater treatment performance is still unclear. In this study, a commonly 
      used QAC, i.e., benzyl dodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide (BDAB), was added to a 
      moving-bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) to investigate BDAB's effect on nutrient 
      removal. When the BDAB concentration was increased to 50 mg L(-1), the ammonia 
      removal efficiency (ARE) greatly decreased, as did the nitrate production rate 
      constants (NPR). This inhibition was partly recovered by decreasing the BDAB 
      concentration to 30 mg L(-1). Metagenomic sequencing revealed the functional 
      genera present during different stages of the control (Rc) and BDAB-added 
      reactors (Re). The enriched genera (Rudaea, Nitrosospira, Sphingomonas, and 
      Rhodanobacter) in Rc mainly related to the nitrogen metabolism, while the 
      enriched genera in Re was BDAB-concentration dependent. Functional genes analysis 
      suggested that a lack of ammonia oxidase-encoding genes (amoABC) may have caused 
      a decrease in ARE in Re, while the efflux pump-encoding genes emrE, mdfA, and 
      oprM and a gene encoding BAC oxygenase (oxyBAC) were responsible for BDAB 
      resistance. The increase in the total abundance of antibiotic resistance genes 
      (ARGs) in Re revealed a potential risk arising from BDAB. Overall, this study 
      revealed the potential effect and ecological risks of BDAB introduction in WWTPs.
