N2  - Listeria monocytogenes is an important human pathogen with a high mortality rate. Consumption of contaminated ready-to-eat food is the main mode of transmission to humans. Disinfectant-tolerant L. monocytogenes have emerged, which are believed to have increased persistence potential. Elucidating the mechanisms of L. monocytogenes disinfectant tolerance has been the focus of previous studies using pure cultures. A limitation of such approach is the difficulty to identify strains with reduced susceptibility due to inter-strain variation and the need to screen large numbers of strains and genes. In this study, we applied a novel metagenomic approach to detect genes associated with disinfectant tolerance in mixed L. monocytogenes planktonic communities. Two communities, consisting of 71 and 80 isolates each, were treated with the food industry disinfectants benzalkonium chloride (BC, 1.75 mg/L) or peracetic acid (PAA, 38 mg/L). The communities were subjected to metagenomic sequencing and differences in individual gene abundances between biocide-free control communities and biocide-treated communities were determined. A significant increase in the abundance of Listeria phage-associated genes was observed in both communities after treatment, suggesting that prophage carriage could lead to an increased disinfectant tolerance in mixed L. monocytogenes planktonic communities. In contrast, a significant decrease in the abundance of a high-copy emrC-harbouring plasmid pLmN12–0935 was observed in both communities after treatment. In PAA-treated community, a putative ABC transporter previously found to be necessary for L. monocytogenes resistance to antimicrobial agents and virulence, was among the genes with the highest weight for differentiating treated from control samples. The undertaken metagenomic approach in this study can be applied to identify genes associated with increased tolerance to other antimicrobials in mixed bacterial communities.

N2  - Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) represent one of the significant causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and controlling pathogens in the hospital environment is of great importance. Currently, the standard disinfection method in the hospital environment is chemical disinfection. However, disinfectants are usually not used strictly according to the label, making them less effective in disinfection. Therefore, there is an emergent need to find a better approach that can be used in hospitals to control pathogenic bacteria in the clinical environment. Bacteriophages (phages) are effective in killing bacteria and have been applied in the treatment of bacterial infections but have not received enough attention regarding the control of contamination in the clinical environment. In this study, we found that various phages remain active in the presence of chemical disinfectants. Moreover, the combined use of specific phages and chemical disinfectants is more effective in removing bacterial biofilms and eliminating bacteria on hard surfaces. Thus, this proof-of-concept study indicates that adding phages directly to chemical disinfectants might be an effective and economical approach to enhance clinical environment disinfection.

N2  - The pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which unpredictably exploded in late December of 2019 has stressed the importance of being able to control potential pathogens with the aim of limiting their spread. Although vaccines are well known as a powerful tool for ensuring public health and controlling the pandemic, disinfection and hygiene habits remain crucial to prevent infection from spreading and maintain the barrier, especially when the microorganism can persist and survive on textiles, surfaces, and medical devices. During the coronavirus disease pandemic, around half of the disinfectants authorized by the US Environmental Protection Agency contained quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs); their effectiveness had not been proven. Herein, the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by p-bromodomiphen bromide, namely bromiphen (BRO), a new, potent, and fast-acting QAC is reported. This study demonstrates that BRO, with a dose as low as 0.02%, can completely inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in just 30 s. Its virucidal activity was 10- and 100-fold more robust compared to other commercially available QACs, namely domiphen bromide and benzalkonium chloride. The critical micellar concentration and the molecular lipophilicity potential surface area support the relevance of the lipophilic nature of these molecules for their activity.

N2  - Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are commonly used in a variety of consumer and commercial products, typically as a component of disinfectants. During the COVID-19 pandemic, QACs became one of the primary agents utilized to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus on surfaces. However, the ecotoxicological effects of QACs upon aquatic organisms have not been fully assessed. In this study, we examined the effects of a widely used QAC (benzalkonium chloride-C14, BAC-14) on two toxigenic Microcystis strains and one non-toxigenic freshwater Microcystis strain and carried out an analysis focused on primary, adaptive and compensatory stress responses at apical (growth and photosynthesis) and metabolic levels. This analysis revealed that the two toxic Microcystis strains were more tolerant than the non-toxic strain, with 96 hr-EC50 values of 0.70, 0.76, and 0.38 mg/L BAC-14 for toxigenic M. aeruginosa FACHB-905, toxigenic M. aeruginosa FACHB-469, and non-toxigenic M. wesenbergii FACHB-908, respectively. The photosynthetic activities of the Microcystis, assessed via Fv/Fm values, were significantly suppressed under 0.4 mg/L BAC-14. Furthermore, this analysis revealed that BAC-14 altered 14, 12, and 8 metabolic pathways in M. aeruginosa FACHB-905, M. aeruginosa FACHB-469, and M. wesenbergii FACHB-908, respectively. It is noteworthy that BAC-14 enhanced the level of extracellular microcystin production in the toxigenic Microcystis strains, although cell growth was not significantly affected. Collectively, these data show that BAC-14 disrupted the physiological and metabolic status of Microcystis cells and stimulated the production and release of microcystin, which could result in damage to aquatic systems.

N2  - Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are used in consumer and industrial products, including disinfectants. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, disinfectant use has increased, purportedly increasing loads to wastewater treatment plants and the environment. To understand how the increased usage has affected QAC loadings to treatment plants and to determine how effectively plants remove QACs from liquid effluent that is discharged to surface and groundwaters, influent and effluent wastewater samples were collected from four treatment plants (treatment capacities < 5 MGD to > 100 MGD) for 21 months beginning in May 2020. Influent QAC concentrations were hundreds of μg/L and effluent QAC concentrations were < 1 μg/L, corresponding to an average removal of 98% from all four plants. The most prevalent QACs in influent were those used most commonly in disinfectants, specifically benzylalkyldimethylammonium compounds (BACs) and short-chain dialkyldimethylammonium compounds (DADMACs), and influent levels of these compounds were correlated with QAC sales. Prior to this study, ethylbenzylalkyldimethylammonium compounds (EtBACs) had not been studied, and they comprised 13 ± 6% of QACs in influent. While removal was high at all plants, low μg/L concentrations were still continuously discharged into the environment. For QACs with equivalent alkyl chain lengths, those with aromatic substituents (BACs and EtBACs) appear to be removed more effectively than those with only alkyl chains (DADMACs).

N2  - Background. Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is an urgent antimicrobial resistant threat due to its resistance to many antibiotics. There is a concern that some antibiotic-resistant strains of A. baumannii might also express resistance to biocides, including disinfectants and antiseptics. However, relatively little information is available on the susceptibility of A. baumannii to disinfectants. Methods. Thirty well-characterized clinical A. baumannii isolates were studied, including 24 (%) CRAB isolates and 11 (37%) with qacE1 and amvA efflux pump genes. The efficacy of sodiumhypochlorite (1:10 dilution of household bleach) and virex-II 256 (quaternary ammonium disinfectant) was evaluated using a standard disk-based quantitative carrier test method (ASTME2197-11) in the presence of 5%fetal calf serum. The disinfectants were tested at in-use concentrations with themanufacturer-recommended exposure times. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to virex-II 256, povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine, and were determined using a broth microdilution method. Serial passage of A. baumannii in subinhibitory concentrations of virex-II 256 were performed to assess the potential for emergence of resistance. Results. All 30 A. baumanii isolates were reduced to undetectable levels (>5.4 log10 reduction) by both disinfectants. MICs for povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine, and virex-II 256 were 2343.75 to 9375 μg/ml, 0.62 to 12.5 μg/ml, 1.06 to 2.03μg/ml, respectively. With serial passage in subinhibitory concentrations of virex-II 256, the MICs of virex-II 256 increased 4-fold from 2.03 to 8 μg/ml, and some strains developed increases in chlorhexidine MICS from 12.5 to 50 μg/ml. Conclusion. Sodium hypochlorite and a quaternary ammonium disinfectant were effective at in-use concentrations against A. baumannii, including CRAB strains and isolates with efflux pumps. Exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of quaternary ammonium compounds may result in increases in MICs in these disinfectants and other biocides.

N2  - Background: The microbicidal efficacy of hand sanitizer formulations is usually measured through standardized quantitative suspension tests and fingerpad tests; these cannot evaluate long-lasting formulations or are impractical due to biological risks, high cost, or time required for testing. With increased numbers of long-lasting microbicidal activity claims of commercially available hand sanitizers, alternative testing strategies are required. Aim: To explore the use of a standardized ex-vivo pig skin model to reproducibly measure long-lasting efficacy of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer formulation. Methods: The microbicidal efficacy of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the enveloped virus SARS-CoV-2 with quantitative suspension tests (EN13727 and EN14476) with a contact time of 5 min. The product was then tested over a 6 h period using an ex-vivo pig skin model with a modified version of PAS 2424 to simulate the impact of skin abrasion. Findings: Quantitative suspension tests yielded a >5 log10 reduction for all organisms tested within a 5 min contact time. Pig skin tests showed reduced but consistent efficacy at all time points and indicated no significant impact of abrasion on efficacy. Conclusion: The use of the ex-vivo pig skin model provides a potentially viable and convenient model system to test long-lasting hand sanitizer formulations, providing a path for sustainable hand sanitizer formulation claims of activity on skin.

N2  - This quantitative review and systematic analysis of the effectiveness of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) in disinfesting nonfungal plant pathogens in agricultural and horticultural cropping systems is a complementary follow-up to a previous study that evaluated the efficacy of QACs against fungal plant pathogens. In the present study, a meta-analysis involving 67 studies was conducted to assess the overall efficacy of QACs against plant pathogenic bacteria, oomycetes, and viruses and to identify factors associated with observed differences in product efficacy. Across all studies, QACs resulted in a significant (P < 0.0001) reduction in either disease intensity or propagule viability with a mean Hedges' g ([Formula: see text]) of 1.75, indicating that overall QAC treatments were moderately effective against nonfungal pathogens. Significant differences in product efficacy were observed between organism types (P = 0.0001), with QAC interventions resulting in higher efficacy (P = 0.0002) against oomycetes ([Formula: see text] = 4.20) than against viruses ([Formula: see text] = 1.42) and bacteria ([Formula: see text] = 1.07), which were not different (P = 0.2689) from each other. As a result, bacterium and virus types were combined into a composite set (BacVir). QAC intervention against BacVir resulted in significant differences in efficacy within categorical moderator subgroups for genus (P = 0.0133), target material (P = 0.0001), and QAC product generation (P = 0.0281). QAC intervention against oomycetes resulted in significant differences in efficacy only for genus (P < 0.0001). For the BacVir composite, five random effect (RE) meta-regression models were significant (P = 0.05), where models with dose and time, dose and genus, time and genus, dose and target, and time and target accounted for 62, 61, 52, 83, and 88%, respectively, of the variance in true effect sizes (R2) associated with [Formula: see text]. For oomycetes, three RE meta-regression models were significant (P = 0.05), where models with dose and time, dose and genus, and time and genus accounted for 64, 86, and 90%, respectively, of R2 associated with [Formula: see text]. These results show that while QACs are moderately effective against nonfungal plant pathogens, the observed variability in their efficacy due to dose of active ingredient and contact time of these products can be influenced by organism type, genus within organism type, the target being treated, and the generation of QAC products.

N2  - Background: Hand hygiene is critical to lower the potential for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious agents by direct contact. When running water and soap are not available for hand hygiene, ethanol-based hand sanitizers are currently the recommended standard of care [1–3]. Though recently published data showed comparable in vitro effectiveness of benzalkonium chloride (BAK)-based and ethanol-based hand sanitizers against SARS-CoV-2 virus, a paucity of peer-reviewed data on the effectiveness of these formulations against other types of infective coronaviruses remains. This work assessed human coronavirus HCoV-229E (genus Alphacoronavirus) concurrently with SARS-CoV-2, Isolate USA-WA1/2020 (genus Betacoronavirus) to fill this gap. Methods: The test was conducted according to EN14476:2013-A2:2019 [EN14476] Quantitative Suspension Test for the Evaluation of Virucidal Activity in the Medical Area [4]. Two BAK-based hand sanitizers, five ethanol-based hand sanitizers, and an 80% ethanol reference formulation were tested for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E at 15- and 30- second contact times. Results: Both SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E were reduced by greater than 4.00-log10 within 15 seconds of contact. Virus decay constants (k) following first-order kinetics were similar for BAK and ethanol-based formulations against both test viruses. The SARS-CoV-2 results reported herein mirrored previous data reported by Herdt et al. (2021). Conclusion: BAK and ethanol hand sanitizer formulations inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E at similar rates. This data supports previously published effectiveness data for both chemistries and indicates that additional coronavirus strains and variants would demonstrate similar inactivation trends.

N2  - During the pandemic of COVID-19, the amounts of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) used to inactivate the virus in public facilities, hospitals and households increased, which raised concerns about the evolution and transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Although QACs may play an important role in the propagation of antibiotic resistance gene (ARGs), the potential contribution and mechanism remains unclear. Here, the results showed that benzyl dodecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DDBAC) and didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC) significantly promoted plasmid RP4-mediated ARGs transfer within and across genera at environmental relevant concentrations (0.0004–0.4 mg/L). Low concentrations of QACs did not contribute to the permeability of the cell plasma membrane, but significantly increased the permeability of the cell outer membrane due to the decrease in content of lipopolysaccharides. QACs altered the composition and content of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and were positively correlated with the conjugation frequency. Furthermore, transcriptional expression levels of genes encode for mating pairing formation (trbB), DNA replication and translocation (trfA), and global regulators (korA, korB, trbA) are regulated by QACs. And we demonstrate for the first time that QACs decreased the concentration of extracellular AI-2 signals, which was verified to be involved in regulating conjugative transfer genes (trbB, trfA). Collectively, our findings underscore the risk of increased disinfectant concentrations of QACs on the ARGs transfer and provide new mechanisms of plasmid conjugation.

N2  - Despite their importance in combating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse effects of disinfectants on human health, especially the respiratory system, have been of continuing concern to researchers. Considering that bronchi are the main target of sprayed disinfectants, we here treated the seven major active ingredients in disinfectant products accepted by the US EPA to human bronchial epithelial cells and determined the subtoxic levels. Then, we performed microarray analysis using total RNA obtained at the subtoxic level and designed a network representing disinfectant-induced cellular response using the KEGG pathway analysis technique. Polyhexamethylguanidine phosphate, a lung fibrosis inducer, was used as a reference material to verify the relationship between cell death and pathology. The derived results reveal potential adverse effects along with the need for an effective application strategy for each chemical.

N2  - African swine fever (ASF) is an economically important disease due to high morbidity and mortality rates and the ability to affect all ages and breeds of pigs. Biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of the causative agent, African swine fever virus (ASFV), include prescriptive cleaning and disinfection procedures. The aim of this study was to establish the biocidal effects of twenty-four commercially available disinfectants including oxidizing agents, acids, aldehydes, formic acids, phenol, and mixed-class chemistries against ASFV. The products were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions and a suspension assay was performed with ASFV strain, BA71V using Vero cells (African green monkey cells) to test efficacy in reducing ASFV infection of cells. Generally, disinfectants containing formic acid and phenolic compounds, as well as oxidizing agents reduced viral titers of ASFV by over 4 log10 at temperatures ranging from 4 °C to 20 °C. Hydrogen peroxide, aldehyde, and quaternary ammonium compounds containing disinfectants were cytotoxic, limiting the detection of viral infectivity reductions to less than 4 log10. These preliminary results can be used to target research on disinfectants which contain active ingredients with known efficacy against ASFV under conditions recommended for the country where their use will be applied.

N2  - Decapod iridescent virus 1 (DIV1) is a lethal virus that has a significant influence on the shrimp and prawn culture industries. The mechanism through which infected prawns respond to the DIV1 virus is currently unknown. Here, we examined in detail the clinical signs, histopathology, and humoral, cellular, and immune-related gene responses after a sub-lethal dose of DIV1 during the acute infection period of 0–120 h post infection (hpi). Interestingly, at the end of the experiment, DIV1-infected prawns had black lesions on several external regions. The DIV1-infected prawns also exhibited few karyopyknotic nuclei in the gills and intestine tissues and exhibited increasing immunological responses, as revealed by significant increases in all examined parameters, including total hemocytes, phagocytosis, lysozyme, and overall bactericidal activity, from 6 to 48 hpi. In addition, between 72 and 120 hpi, all immune response activities of DIV1-infected prawn were impaired compared with those of normal prawns, indicating negative impacts on immunological parameters. A viral load analysis of various tissues by qPCR indicated that hemocytes were the dominant initial viral target tissues, followed by the gills and hepatopancreas. An expression analysis of crucial immune-related genes by qRT‒PCR revealed various expression patterns in response to DIV1 infection; in particular, fold changes in the relative expression of anti-lipopolysaccharide factors (ALFs), prophenoloxidase (proPO), lipopolysaccharide and β-1,3-glucan binding protein (LGBP) were observed. Additionally, five common chemicals, calcium hypochlorite [Ca(OCl)2] at 16.25–130 ppm, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at 8.75–70 ppm, povidone iodine (PVP–I) at 3–24 ppm, benzalkonium chloride (BKC) at 20–160 ppm, and formalin at 25–200 ppm, had a significant effect on the killing of DIV1 particles in vitro within 24 h after exposure. These data will be helpful for determining the health status and immune defense mechanisms of giant river prawns during DIV1 infection periods. The study performed the first application of very common disinfectants, and the obtained information will be useful for implementing effective strategies to prevent and control DIV1 infection in both hatchery and grow-out ponds.

N2  - Benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) are widely used antimicrobials in a variety of consumer products and settings, including disinfectants, medical products, and food-processing industry. Though initially recognized as safe, the FDA has called for additional safety data on BAC use in consumer products. Their toxicity becomes especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the increased use of BAC-containing disinfectant products. BAC exposure in rats led to their accumulation primarily in the kidney (42- fold higher than blood); in contrast, accumulation did not occur in the liver, likely due to efficient metabolism of BACs by hepatic cytochromes P450 (CYPs), mainly CYP4F isoforms and CYP2D6. Thus, we hypothesized that BAC-metabolizing capacity determines the extent of the buildup of BACs in the kidney and subsequent kidney injury. Human kidney and liver microsomes were incubated with 1 μM C12-BAC over 8 time points between 0 and 64 minutes, and LC-MS analysis showed C12-BAC was consumed much slower in the kidney microsomes than the liver microsomes, with the half-lives being 50 and 2.5 min, respectively. We then used cell viability assays to investigate the nephrotoxicity of C10-, C12-, C14- and C16-BAC and their ω-OH metabolites ranging from 0-40 mM over 48 hours in 2D-cultured human proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs). In general, the parent compounds displayed much larger cytotoxicity (at least 7-17-fold) than their ω-OH metabolites, suggesting BAC metabolism by CYPs detoxifies BACs. EC50 for C12-BAC is approximately 3 mM while the EC50 for the C14- and C16-BACs is around 1 μM. The EC50 value for C10-BAC was not captured in the concentration range examined. BAC-metabolizing CYP4F11 and CYP4F12 are expressed in the kidney, but administration of a CYP4F inhibitor, HET0016, to inhibit the metabolism of BACs did not significantly increase the cytotoxicity of parent BACs, suggesting that BAC metabolism by the kidney is not sufficient to detoxify them. We then examined the nephrotoxicity of BACs using a kidney-on-a-chip microphysiological system (MPS), in which the microenvironment of the chip mimics the functional characteristics of human proximal tubules. We found that 1 mMof C14-BAC exerts potent toxicity to human PTECs in the kidney MPS system, compared to the untreated channel. However, kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) displayed no difference between the C14-BAC and untreated channels, suggesting an alternative cell death mechanism by BACs. To summarize, our data suggest that the kidney has smaller BAC-metabolizing capacities than the liver and that BACs can potentially cause nephrotoxicity in humans.

N2  - Human pathogenic viruses that are present in bioaerosols released by coughing, sneezing, or breathing can contaminate fomites and other inanimate environmental surfaces. Most are enveloped respiratory viruses that are vulnerable to inactivation by a broad spectrum of antimicrobial actives. Quaternary ammonium compounds are highly diverse in structure and are among the most widely utilized antimicrobial agents. The objective of this study was to evaluate two commercially available, ready-to-use quaternary ammonium compound-based disinfectants (one of which also contains a surface binding agent) for antiviral activity against Influenza A (H1N1), human coronavirus 229E, and SARS-CoV-2 (Washington) following a rigorous procedure of wear and abrasions with regular re-inoculations of virus in the presence of a 6% organic soil load. Formulation TF-A demonstrated variable residual efficacy against the three viruses, achieving log10 reductions of 1.62, 3.33, and 0.92, respectively. Formulation TF-B lowered each test virus by greater than 3-log10 to non-detectable levels on all carriers in demonstration of residual antiviral activity.

N2  - The environmental stability of human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) on the surface of human skin and the effectiveness of disinfectant against HCoV-OC43, which are important to prevent contact transmission, have not been clarified in previous studies. Using previously generated models, we evaluated HCoV-OC43 stability and disinfection effectiveness. Then we compared the results with those for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The median survival time of HCoVOC43 on the surface of human skin was 24.6 h (95% confidence interval, 19.7 to 29.6 h), which was higher than that of SARS-CoV-2 (10.8 h). Although the in vitro disinfectant effectiveness evaluation showed that HCoV-OC43 has a higher ethanol resistance than SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 on the skin surface was completely inactivated by a minimum of 50% ethanol within 5 s (the log reduction values were .4.0). Moreover, 1.0% chlorhexidine gluconate and 0.2% benzalkonium chloride showed relatively high disinfectant effectiveness, and the log reduction values when these disinfectants were applied for 15 s were .3.0. HCoV-OC43 is highly stable on the skin surface, which may increase the risk of contact transmission. Although HCoV-OC43 has relatively high ethanol resistance, appropriate hand hygiene practices with current alcohol-based disinfectants sufficiently reduce the risk of contact transmission. IMPORTANCE This study revealed the environmental stability of HCoV-OC43 and disinfectant effectiveness against HCoV-OC43, which had not been demonstrated in previous studies. HCoV-OC43 is highly stable on the surface of human skin, with a survival time of approximately 25 h. High stability of HCoV-OC43 may increase the risk of contact transmission. Furthermore, the in vitro disinfectant effectiveness evaluation showed that HCoV-OC43, which is classified as an envelope virus, has a relatively high ethanol resistance. This finding suggests that disinfectant effectiveness may vary greatly depending on the virus and that each virus targeted for infection control should be evaluated individually. HCoV-OC43 on the skin surface was rapidly inactivated by 50% ethanol, which suggests that appropriate hand hygiene practices with current alcohol-based disinfectants can sufficiently reduce the risk of HCoV-OC43 contact transmission.

N2  - Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a pathogen responsible for various community and hospital-acquired infections with life-threatening complications like bacteraemia, endocarditis, meningitis, liver abscess, and spinal cord epidural abscess. Antibiotics have been used to treat microbial infections since the introduction of penicillin in 1940. In recent decades, the abuse and misuse of antibiotics in humans, animals, plants, and fungi, including the treatment of non-microbial diseases, have led to the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens with increased virulence. Bacteria have developed several complementary mechanisms to avoid the effects of antibiotics. These mechanisms include chemical transformations and enzymatic inactivation of antibiotics, modification of antibiotics' target site, and reduction of intracellular antibiotics concentration by changes in membrane permeability or by the overexpression of efflux pumps (EPs). The strategy to check antibiotic resistance includes synthesis of the antibiotic analogues, or antibiotics are given in combination with the adjuvant. The inhibitors of multidrug EPs are considered promising alternative therapeutic options with the potential to revive the effects of antibiotics and reduce bacterial virulence. Natural products played a vital role in drug discovery and significantly contributed to the area of infectious diseases. Also, natural products provide lead compounds that sometimes need modification based on structural and biological properties to meet the drug criteria. This review discusses natural products and their derived compounds as NorA efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs).

N2  - Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated the need for novel, affordable, and efficient reagents to help reduce viral transmission, especially in high-risk environments including medical treatment facilities, close quarters, and austere settings. We examined transition-metal nanozeolite suspensions and quaternary ammonium compounds as an antiviral surface coating for various textile materials. Methods: Zeolites are crystalline porous aluminosilicate materials, with the ability of ion-exchanging different cations. Nanozeolites (30 nm) were synthesized and then ion-exchanged with silver, zinc and copper ions. Benzalkonium nitrate (BZN) was examined as the quaternary ammonium ion (quat). Suspensions of these materials were tested for antiviral activity towards SARS-CoV-2 using plaque assay and immunostaining. Suspensions of the nanozeolite and quat were deposited on polyester and cotton fabrics and the ability of these textiles towards neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 was examined. Results: We hypothesized that transition metal ion containing zeolites, particularly silver and zinc (AM30) and silver and copper (AV30), would be effective in reducing the infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Additionally, AM30 and AV30 antiviral potency was tested when combined with a quaternary ammonium carrier, BZN. Our results indicate that exposure of SARS-CoV-2 to AM30 and/or AV30 suspensions reduced viral loads with time and exhibited dose-dependence. Antiviral activities of the combination of zeolite and BZN compositions were significantly enhanced. When used in textiles, AM30 and AV30-coated cotton and polyester fabrics alone or in combination with BZN exhibited significant antiviral properties, which were maintained even after various stress tests, including washes, SARS-CoV-2-repeated exposures, or treatments with soil-like materials. Conclusion: This study shows the efficacy of transition metal nanozeolite formulations as novel antiviral agents and establishes that nanozeolite with silver and zinc ions (AM30) and nanozeolite with silver and copper ions (AV30) when combined with benzalkonium nitrate (BZN) quickly and continuously inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in suspension and on fabric materials.

N2  - Outbreaks of viral diseases in animals are a cause of concern for animal welfare and economics of animal production. One way to disrupt the cycle of infection is by combating viruses in the environment and prohibiting them from being transmitted to a new host. Viral contamination of the environment can be reduced using well-tested and efficacious disinfectants. Duplalim is a commercially available disinfectant consisting of 12% glutaraldehyde and 10% quaternary ammonium compounds. We evaluated this disinfectant for its efficacy against several viruses in poultry (n = 3), pigs (n = 5), dogs (n = 2), and cattle (n = 4). In suspension tests, 1:100 dilution of Duplalim was found to inactivate more than 99% of these 14 viruses in 15 min or less. The titers of a majority of these viruses decreased by ≥99.99% in <60 min of contact time. In conclusion, the ingredient combination in Duplalim is very effective in inactivating common viruses of domestic animals and poultry.

N2  - Introduction. Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a key topic addressed globally. It is unthinkable to tackle such a multifaceted problem focusing only on the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy: prevention in the hospital setting plays an important role as well. The purpose of this work is to collect, review and resume scientific data regarding the cross resistance between some disinfectants and antibiotics. Materials and methods. A review of the national and international literature was carried out on PubMed and on the Italian Journal of Clinical Pharmacy. The searched keywords were “chlorhexidine”, “biocides”, “cross resistance” and “antimicrobial resistance”. Results. Chlorhexidine can induce cross-resistance against several antibiotics: colistin, ceftazidime, sulfamethoxazole, imipenem, cefotaxime and tetracycline. Resistance to ampicillin, nalidixic acid and tobramycin has also been detected. The mechanisms of resistance to chlorhexidine revealed in this study are different. Chlorhexidine is ineffective against non-enveloped viruses showing variable potency for inactivating enveloped viruses. Against the human coronavirus HCoV-299E, chlorhexidine has shown limited efficacy. SARS-CoV-1 is sensitive to peracetic acid, 70% ethanol, sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine digluconate, while influenza A virus shows resistance to chlorhexidine digluconate and benzalkonium chloride (BAC). Conclusions. In the context of antimicrobial stewardship, efforts must aim at improving patient safety and the quality of pharmaceutical assistance, thus guaranteeing the best possible therapeutic choice. In this scenario, the skills of the Hospital Pharmacist are essential to carry out a careful activity of surveillance of infections and monitoring of antibiotic and antiviral prescriptions in terms of appropriateness by indication, dosage and duration as well as the onset of resistance to biocides determined by the incorrect application of disinfection protocols. This work aims to raise awareness of how the improperly controlled application of disinfection protocols significantly increases the risk of resistance to the biocides used in normal clinical practice. The data presented highlights how the activity of the Hospital Pharmacist, through the "One Health" approach, can be of supportive in avoiding the establishment of such mechanisms to safeguard the health and safety of the patients.

N2  - Aims: This study evaluated the residual efficacy of commercially available antimicrobial coatings or films against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on non-porous surfaces. Methods and Results: Products were applied to stainless steel or ABS plastic coupons and dried overnight. Coupons were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of 5% soil load. Recovered infectious SARS-CoV-2 was quantified by TCID50 assay. Tested product efficacies ranged from <1.0 to >3.0 log10 reduction at a 2-h contact time. The log10 reduction in recovered infectious SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 0.44 to 3 log10 reduction on stainless steel and 0.25 to >1.67 log10 on ABS plastic. The most effective products tested contained varying concentrations (0.5%–1.3%) of the same active ingredient: 3-(trihydroxysilyl) propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride. Products formulated with other quaternary ammonium compounds were less effective against SARS-CoV-2 in this test. Conclusions: The residual antimicrobial products tested showed varied effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 as a function of product tested. Several products were identified as efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 on both stainless steel and ABS plastic surfaces under the conditions evaluated. Differences in observed efficacy may be due to variation in active ingredient formulation; efficacy is, therefore, difficult to predict based upon listed active ingredient and its concentration. Significance and Impact: This study highlights the formulation-specific efficacy of several products against SARS-CoV-2 and may inform future development of residual antiviral products for use on non-porous surfaces. The identification of antimicrobial coatings or films showing promise to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 suggests that these products may be worth future testing and consideration.

N2  - Aims: Antimicrobial coatings, for use in combination with routine cleaning and disinfection, were evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing virus concentration on stainless steel surfaces. Methods: Twenty antimicrobial coating products, predominantly composed of organosilane quaternary ammonium compounds, were applied to stainless steel coupons, dried overnight and evaluated for efficacy against Φ6, an enveloped bacteriophage. Additionally, two peel and stick polymer-based films, a copper-based film and three copper alloys were evaluated. Efficacy was determined by comparison of recoveries from uncoated (positive control) and coated (test) surfaces. Results: The results indicated that some of the coating products initially demonstrated >3-log reduction of Φ6; no direct correlation of efficacy was observed with an active ingredient or its concentration. The peel and stick films and copper alloys each demonstrated efficacy in initial testing. However, none of the spray-based products retained efficacy after subjecting the coating to abrasion with either a hypochlorite or quaternary ammonium-based solution applied in accordance with EPA Interim Guidance for Evaluating the Efficacy of Antimicrobial Surface Coatings. Of the products tested for this durability, only one peel and stick polymeric film retained efficacy; the copper alloys were not tested for their durability in this study. Conclusions: These results suggest that while some organosilane quaternary ammonium compound-based products demonstrate antiviral efficacy, more research and development is needed to understand effective formulations with sufficient durability to perform as supplements to routine cleaning and disinfection.

N2  - Povidone-iodine (PVI) is a universally accepted antiseptic agent used in ophthalmic surgery. Insufficient antisepsis in patients with self-reported allergies to iodine has led to devastating complications. The aim of this study was to review the current evidence for alternatives to PVI in ocular surgery. Aqueous chlorhexidine has been used as a primary antiseptic agent in Sweden for several years and has proven efficiency and safety; in a study of a large series of intravitreal injections in Australia, the endophthalmitis rates were similar to those after the use of PVI. The evidence related to using other disinfectants such as picloxydine, hypochlorous acid solution, and polyhexanide is scarce. Single studies have shown lower patient discomfort after conjunctival lavage with chlorhexidine or hypochlorous acid than with PVI. No evidence was found to suggest changing from PVI to other antiseptic agents. Disinfectant solutions other than PVI or chlorhexidine will require further investigations to show their utility in ocular surgery.

N2  - Covid 19 is a pandemic disease spread almost in the whole world. To date, no medical advancement to curb the virus. Coronavirus is an enveloped virus transmitted from the biological and non-biological surface by direct or indirect contact. Limited literature revealed that the enveloped virus can be killed by disinfectants. There are many biocidal agents used for decontamination of the virus, yet they have many issues like toxicity, killing time, activation requirement, etc. Some are specific to the inanimate surface but not used by a human being. This current situation showed an urgent need for a biocidal agent which can act on biological as well as non-biological surfaces without any potential toxicity. Moreover, it should be easy to handle, inexpensive, and safe for the environment. Hypochlorous acid is a weak acid that acts as a powerful disinfectant and shows biocidal efficacy against a wide range of microorganisms. Hypochlorous acid is simple to use, inexpensive, eco-friendly, non-toxic, and stable. The properties of HOCl can be regulated at the site of preparation and therefore, its compliance is high. Hypochlorous acid seems to be a promising agent in disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities. Due to its diverse biocidal actions, it may be used as a potent disinfectant against novel coronavirus.

N2  - Quaternary cationic surfactants with bactericidal activity such as Didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) show an inactivation effect on enveloped viruses, but they have little effect on non-enveloped viruses such as noroviruses. Therefore, we examined additives that enhance the inactivation effect of cationic surfactants by using Feline calicivirus (FCV) as a representative of a non-enveloped virus. The result was that SO42- ions, which are a general-purpose salt, had a strong salting-out effect that reduced the solubility of proteins, greatly enhancing the inactivation ability of DDAC. The SO42- ions also enhanced FCV inactivation by other cationic surfactants such as Cetylpyridinium Chloride (CPC) and Benzalkonium chloride (ADBAC). To clarify the mechanism, we evaluated the denaturation and binding process of DDAC to Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as a model protein by means of Circular Dichroism (CD) spectrum and Isothermal Titration Calorimeter (ITC), respectively. The SO42- ions disturbed the protein structure by their salting-out effect and promoted cooperative binding from lower DDAC concentrations by reducing the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC), indicating that these synergistic effects caused a large structural change in the protein. These results suggested that increasing the protein denaturation of the cationic surfactants by adding SO42- ions enhanced the inactivation effect on the non-enveloped virus.

N2  - Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are active ingredients of many disinfectants used against SARS-CoV-2 to control the transmission of the virus through human-contact surfaces. As a result, QAC consumption has increased more than twice during the pandemic. Consequently, the concentration of QACs in wastewater and receiving environments may increase. Due to their antimicrobial activity, high levels of QACs in wastewater may cause malfunctioning of biological treatment systems resulting in inadequate treatment of wastewater. In this study, a biocatalyst was produced by entrapping Pseudomonas sp. BIOMIG1 capable of degrading QACs in calcium alginate. Bioactive 3-mm alginate beads degraded benzalkonium chlorides (BACs), a group of QACs, with a rate of 0.47 µM-BACs/h in shake flasks. A bench-scale continuous up-flow reactor packed with BIOMIG1-beads was operated over one and a half months with either synthetic wastewater or secondary effluent containing 2–20 µM BACs at an empty bed contact time (EBCT) ranging between 0.6 and 4.7 h. Almost complete BAC removal was achieved from synthetic and real wastewater at and above 1.2 h EBCT without aeration and effluent recirculation. The microbial community in beads dominantly composed of BIOMIG1 with trace number of Achromobacter spp. after the operation of the reactor with the real wastewater, suggesting that BIOMIG1 over-competed native wastewater bacteria during the operation. This reactor system offers a low cost and robust treatment of QACs in wastewater. It can be integrated to conventional treatment systems for efficient removal of QACs from the wastewater, especially during the pandemic period.

N2  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread globally and has severely impacted public health and the economy. Hand hygiene, social distancing, and the usage of personal protective equipment are considered the most vital tools in controlling the primary transmission of the virus. Converging evidence indicated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and its persistence over several days, which may create secondary transmission of the virus via waterborne and wastewater pathways. Although, researchers have started focusing on this mode of virus transmission, limited knowledge and societal unawareness of the transmission through wastewater may lead to significant increases in the number of positive cases. To emphasize the severe issue of virus transmission through wastewater and create societal awareness, we present a state of the art critical review on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and the potential remedial strategies to effectively control the viral spread and safeguard society. For low-income countries with high population densities, it is suggested to identify the virus in large scale municipal wastewater plants before following up with one-to-one testing for effective control of the secondary transmission. Ultrafiltration is an effective method for wastewater treatment and usually more than 4 logs of virus removal are achieved while safeguarding good protein permeability. Decentralized wastewater treatment facilities using solar-assisted disinfestation methods are most economical and can be effectively used in hospitals, isolation wards, and medical centers for reducing the risk of transmission from high local concentration sites, especially in tropical countries with abundant solar energy. Disinfection with chlorine, sodium hypochlorite, benzalkonium chloride, and peracetic acid have shown potential in terms of virucidal properties. Biological wastewater treatment using micro-algae will be highly effective in removal of virus and can be incorporated into membrane bio-reaction to achieve excellent virus removal rate. Though promising results have been shown by initial research for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater using physical, chemical and biological based treatment methods, there is a pressing need for extensive investigation of COVID-19 specific disinfectants with appropriate concentrations, their environmental implications, and regular monitoring of transmission. Effective wastewater treatment methods with high virus removal capacity and low treatment costs should be selected to control the virus spread and safeguard society from this deadly virus.

N2  - The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe and affected millions of individuals as of the efficient virus transmission potential mediated via multiple virus shedding routes. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the stool samples and its prolonged shedding in environmental compartments like sewage and wastewater signifies a potential threat adding to the transmission cycle of this novel virus. The potential role played by the asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in transmitting the disease via the fecal-oral route is now under investigation. Hence, in the present scenario, wastewater-based epidemiology, and sewage surveillance may provide valuable insights into the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among the human population and could serve as a sensitive surveillance system and a crucial early warning tool. Further studies are required to determine the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment, transmissibility through wastewater, and the potential to infect humans via the fecal-oral route. Appropriate frameworks with regards to evaluation and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 will help implement appropriate intervention strategies and necessary sanitation practices to ensure virus free clean water supply to have a check on the further spread of this pandemic virus.
